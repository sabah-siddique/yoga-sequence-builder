<!-- 
    The idea of this web app is to build a yoga sequence. The user will be taken through
    various categories of poses and, given 2-3 options of poses per category, can choose
    which poses to include in their very own sequence. The categories will follow a 
    general sequencing template. Once the user has chosen all of their poses, they will
    be able to view the entire sequence.
    My vision is to have these poses shown on "cards" with a diagram of the poses, the
    English and Sanskrit names of the pose, and maybe some nice animation on hover and
    on click.
    There can also be an informational page/pop-up about the general sequencing template
    and why those categories go in that particular order.
